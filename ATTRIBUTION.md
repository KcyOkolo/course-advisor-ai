## AI Generated Disclosure:
* Used the tag "# AI generated: Claude" above code chunks that were AI generated.
This tag was used twice, both of which were for error handling and re-formating responses from claude.
Those examples can be found in syllabus_parser.py and integrated_chat.py 

* Used tag "# AI generated: Claude Code" at the beginning of files where I used auto-complete throughout.
These two files were app.py and test_setup.py.
test_setup.py in particular was completely AI generated 

* All other files were created by project developer
